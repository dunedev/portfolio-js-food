# portfolio-js-food

1Ô∏è‚É£ My first project while studying on the course "JavaScript + React". 
Project "Food"ü•ë

In this project, my work was exclusively writing code in native Javascript.

üéØ Tasks before starting work with a project.
1) Working with modal windows:
    Appearance by pressing a button,  
      appearance after a certain period of time. 
    Closing when clicking the cross, 
      and closing when clicking on the substrate.
2) Working with the slider:
      Switching slides with animation when you click on the arrows in both directions 
        and when you click on a specific navigation at the bottom of the slider.
3) Working with a calorie calculator for men and women.
4) Working with a countdown timer.
